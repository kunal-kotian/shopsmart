The ez-melt formula recommended in another review is OK, but it is dissolved in the mouth much more quickly than this lozenge formula, while dissolving more slowly is preferable according to my research.This product has the greatest side effect - since taking it, I haven't had colds or sore throats.  Soon after starting to take it every day, I was starting to come down with a cold, with all my usual symptoms, and was anticipating being very sick the next day, as is my usual pattern.  But I never did get as sick as anticipated - taking this product is the only reason I can come up with.  Since then, I've had no colds or sore throats - it has been great.  I recommend this product to everyone I know, and have given it as gifts to my family. \n",

It's also a lozenge (they call it melt) and it literally melts in your mouth. I have a lot more energy, and haven't been sick at all. I used to get colds and flus all the time before.
