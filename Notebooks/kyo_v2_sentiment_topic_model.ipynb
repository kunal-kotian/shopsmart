I couldn't work in an office without this probiotic relief.\", u\"I love the price on amazon, it is a few dollars less than the cost at my local health food store, and the multipack saves even more. I take one capsule, three times a day in combination with fenugreek (two capsules, two times a day) to 'boost' my bustline. I nursed two children, and my breasts were saggy after I stopped nursing. I can't afford a procedure, so this was my next option, although I was very skeptical to it actually working. But, it did! Now, the results were not huge and dramatic, but they are slightly and noticeably fuller and perkier after several months of taking the combo-it does take that long to notice a difference, so be faithful if you decide to try it. The duo works because it increases estrogen in the body. As with any natural product, you need to evaluate if this is a good thing for you to try or not. Increasing estrogen can be an issue for some women with other problems( uterine, cysts, etc), so please do your research. Many of my supplements are from Nature's Way, because they don't often use stearates in their products, if avoidable. This brand is very pure, the ingredients in this are (per one capsule) fennel seed 480 mg, gelatin and silica. I don't care for gelatin, so I just open the capsules and pour out the powder in a bit of water when I am ready to take them. The taste is like black licorice, but when you also open the fenugreek powder (tastes like bitter maple syrup) and mix in the water with it, its not so bad. Fennel is also supposed to freshen breath and relax the smooth muscles of the digestive system, so there are many other benefits to taking it..

Perhaps you need to check your expiration date or have another member of your house try them because these supplements are amazing and I can see why other reviewers say they are tempted to eat them like candy.

I have never had a bad batch of these to date but I also double check the expiration date before buying them or when I receive them from Amazon in the mail. I have now purchased these several times on Amazon and the expiration has always been at least a year away from the date I actually receive them. So Amazon has fresh stock for sure. They also offer this product at a far superior price to my local stores even when they are on sale. Everyone whom I have recommended this product to has become a huge fan. The peach flavor is my least favorite of the 3, but it is still very good. The 2 berry flavors are amazing. This product definitely deserves the Chef's Best award it received in 2012 for best product. If you have not tried them do not let the one star reviews deter you. My only other comment is that they are meant to be soft because they are a Gummie chewable. So with that said you want to keep them away from direct sun or heat because they will melt.

I do think it helped me to curb my appetite but not totally sure if that was the product or me just taking a pill and having a placebo effect to myself. I did experience a little more of a &#34;flat belly&#34; feeling, meaning that I do not think I was feeling bloated or constipated with this product I feel that it is due to the product itself making me feel a little more comfortable and relaxed and as I said.. more flat-belly effect. I have to admit that I did not take it regularly as I was supposed to, I ended up having a stressful , job change and I put the pills off to the side so that I could begin again once this transition I was in was over. So, when I quit taking them for about a week or so I did note the way I felt when I resumed. I felt 'better&#34; when I took the pills, I do not know if it was because I was once again doing something about my weight and health and so that in itself was what was happening or if it was the pills. But what I mean by better- is that I definitely felt more of a full feeling most times but not over full. I did not crave things and want to constantly eat something I felt satisfied so I am calling that feeling a curbing of my appetite and so that is why I started the review with that point. It is the main thing I think these pills did for me. Scale wise-- I had no difference but feeling-wise, I do believe they helped me feel more alert, less hungry and not so bloated. I think if I had a longer supply of them and would have taken them regularly and with proper amounts of water that I would probably have a very good review to give.

After reading Amazon reviews, I saw this listed as a related supplement and decided to give it a try-- I suffer from Fibromyalgia and saw that it had helped someone else with the disorder.I've been taking three...one at the beginning of the day, one in the afternoon, and one before bed. I ordered with the hopes that it would help me lose weight, and it's working beautifully in that regard!

I was diagnosed with Anxiety Disorder in the past, but try to stray away from prescription drugs. I feel like I can handle the stresses of everyday better, I don't feel as overwhelmed, I'm more focused, and surprise surprise that FOCUS is also helping me to maintain my diet and exercise regimen each day.All of that being said, I'm kinda surprised this isn't more popular.

I am a woman and had horrible nightmares about waking up one morning and being as bald as my husband (some men look good bald, but for a woman, it's definitely not pretty!) I went to dermatologists and internists, but the cause was never resolved. I tried Rogaine for women, then rogaine for men (which did help a bit), special shampoos, change of diet, massive doses of vitamins...but still woke with more hair on my pillow than on my head. My current dermatologist suggested trying Biosil and/or Biotin. I took both. The results were amazing. The fallout ceased within a few weeks. I was thrilled! Later, I thought I might try going off the biosil/biotin to see if it might have been a temporary ailment caused by stress, diet, or just bad luck. Big mistake... the fallout came right back. So I will likely stay on the biotin/biosil combo forever. I don't want to take any chances...its not worth the trauma being bald. It takes a few weeks to get in your system so start as soon as you notice any unusual hair loss. And as a side benefit, my nails have grown longer for the first time in my life.. and my skin actually looks better too. Unexpected benefits. I do believe the liquid formula is absorbed faster than the capsules and is much cheaper in the long term. But the capsules are good for traveling and definitely more convenient. Be warned...the liquid does taste awful, but now I take it with mango juice and can't taste it at all. Try your favorite heavily flavored cold beverage. Experiment. Biosil is definitely worth a try if you find yourself with a hair loss problem. Highly recommend this product and the Biotin as well. Do go to a doctor first, as there may be another underlying cause that you may want to eliminate first. Good luck!. This product is a miracle.

And as a side benefit, my nails have grown longer for the first time in my life.. and my skin actually looks better too. Unexpected benefits. I do believe the liquid formula is absorbed faster than the capsules and is much cheaper in the long term. But the capsules are good for traveling and definitely more convenient. Be warned...the liquid does taste awful, but now I take it with mango juice and can't taste it at all. Try your favorite heavily flavored cold beverage. Experiment. Biosil is definitely worth a try if you find yourself with a hair loss problem. Highly recommend this product and the Biotin as well. Do go to a doctor first, as there may be another underlying cause that you may want to eliminate first.

Honestly, it's as good as a dessert to me.You can also make fruit smoothies with this: one baa, one cup frozen berries, 1/2 cup kefir and 1/2 cup seltzer. The protein keeps you from getting hungry said the nutritionist. You can also add 1/2 vegetables to the mix for additional nutrition -- such as a cucumber, romaine lettuce or spinach.It's great to drink as is and tastes a little like a raspberry fruit smoothie or raspberry pudding. I've tried the peach, pomegranate, strawberry and raspberry and they are delicious. The raspberry is my favorite flavor as it's a little sweet and a little sour. They are probiotic with 12 different kinds of live bacteria and are naturally cultured. Kefir provides 25% of Vitamin D, 30% Calcium and 11g of Protein.

Since it is not mainly the amount of a given nutrient listed on the bottle that is important but instead that nutrients form and how much of it is bio-available that counts I was specifically looking for a whole food based supplement. Whole food supplements are, like the name suggests, supplements made from concentrated whole foods so they contain an array of natural vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, enzymes, co-enzymes, trace elements, and activators that naturally work together. Food based supplements allow your body to absorb the concentrated nutrients of whole foods as if they were a normal part of your everyday diet while synthetic supplements are treated by the body as if they were foreign substances. Some of these \"foreign substances\" are merely rejected while others (in order to be effective) absorb additional nutrients from your body, leaving your body\\'s stores depleted. This is because synthetic vitamins have been isolated from the other nutrients that they would normally be paired with in nature, and without the presence of those nutrients they aren\\'t usable to the body.Since I knew that I only wanted whole food vitamins that narrowed my search significantly; I found that there only seemed to be a few whole food options on the market that were child specific. While these vitamins from Bluebonnet may not be the cheapest supplement around I love that they are whole food based so that I can rest assured that my children are actually benefiting from them. My children also love the fruit flavors of these vitamins...they practically beg for these every morning.

With Natural Calm, I felt immediate, noticeable results with the very first dose. I have been using this product for many years now with very positive results.Several reviewers mentioned negative side effects due to the mixture being too fizzy or effervescent. It is simply a matter of preparing the drink properly, which is very easy to do. When prepared properly, the drink should not be fizzy or effervescent, and should not cause any side effects.It is also important to start with a small dose and gradually increase the dose over time. Drink the mixture gradually through out the day instead of gulping the entire dose at one time.For best results:Start with a teaspoon or so of powder until you find your optimal amount.Measure the powder into a clean, dry, container (a 2-cup Pyrex glass measuring cup works very well).Gradually add 3 or 4 ounces of boiling water. Don't stir yet. Let the powder fizz in the water.When the powder stops fizzing, stir gently with a wooden spoon and the powder will start to fizz again. Stir until all the powder is dissolved and no longer fizzing.Now fill the cup with 8 oz or more water. Hot or cold is fine at this point - whichever you prefer.Hopefully these steps will help new customers to get the most benefit from Natural Calm.

As time has passed, I began to suffer from fatigue, stiffness and muscle pains.A recent blood test showwed that my CPK levels were slightly elevated, but not so much so that I should be alarmed. I began to research C-Q10 in regards to statins on the web and discovered a lot of information describing how statins reduce natural levels of C-Q10 in the body which leads to all of the above problems. If it is not addressed it will eventually damage the heart.Suprisingly, I found that Mercke had actaully been awarded 2 pattents on statins with C-Q10 included in the medication specificall becuase of the known problems with statins. Why they have never manufactured this combinations is a puzzle, but I have concluded on my own that it is to keep that \"bad news\" about statuns under wraps; who knows???Here\\'s what happens. All cells have mitocondria to provide the cells and muscles with energy. Statins zap the process that happens in the mitocondria by inhibiting the production of C-Q10 on the body. Without C-Q10, the mitocondria can not do their job efficiently and then the muscles begin to suffer because of this. Your heart is nothing more than 1 big muscle and it will suffer along with eveything else.Within 24 hours of taking C-Q10 my symptoms had virtually diappeared. After 2 weeks I fell 10 years younger as all of my strength and agility has returned.Great stuff! Do your homework on statins and then decide for yourself if this is right for you.

I've lost 12 pounds in a few weeks with the Slimowill supplement, easily making it the easiest and most cost-effective dieting approach I've ever tried.It's very simple in how it works. The supplement is simply taken in the morning with breakfast. Of course, I wish I could take less pills or take them less often for the same results, but it's very little effort anyway. The supplement helps raise your metabolism while suppressing your appetite. Since you are taking in less calories, you will very likely lose weight. A lot of weight problems are caused by too-large portions and eating too often. The supplement also has the added benefit of providing a great boost of energy.

Even cleaning the house or working on your feet burns calories, so the energy component is a great feature.

They could do nothing more than attacking them as a sweet candy treat. Until all my friends around me start to join this company name Market America, they start to familiarize me with their products. I was very skeptical about all the magic things they claim their supplements can do, but I still decide to give this a try since it does not cost too much as the rest of their supplements. Who would imagine, not only does this powdered vitamin tastes extremely good (like a orange soda), after only one week use, I found significant difference in my kids! My older son who has behavior problems caused by calcium deficiency and very severe allergies, experience the most drastic change. No more watery itchy eyes and sneezes, he is more calm and self controllable. As for my 2nd son who is a very bad eater, he regains his appetite at dinner table, and could sleep soundly through the night without constantly waking up crying.

For any one who want to keep their kids healthy, and to get rid of their behavior problem from the root caused by chemical imbalance, this is the BEST products in the market, period.. With my 3 little ones I've always been looking out for a good children's vitamin supplement, but my choices were basically limited to store brands like the gummy bears, Flintstones and chewables. They could do nothing more than attacking them as a sweet candy treat. Until all my friends around me start to join this company name Market America, they start to familiarize me with their products. I was very skeptical about all the magic things they claim their supplements can do, but I still decide to give this a try since it does not cost too much as the rest of their supplements. Who would imagine, not only does this powdered vitamin tastes extremely good (like a orange soda), after only one week use, I found significant difference in my kids! My older son who has behavior problems caused by calcium deficiency and very severe allergies, experience the most drastic change. No more watery itchy eyes and sneezes, he is more calm and self controllable. As for my 2nd son who is a very bad eater, he regains his appetite at dinner table, and could sleep soundly through the night without constantly waking up crying.

They give me so much energy during the day that I have been able to forego my usual mid-day caffeine pick me up that used to be crucial to keeping up with my two little ones. My youngest just turned one and I continue to take these prenatal vitamins because they give me the nutrients that I otherwise might not fit into my diet of toddler leftovers. Healthy Belly Prenatal Health vitamins are the best thing you can do for you and your baby.', u'Love it. Love it', u\"After researching a few different brands of garcinia cambogia I took a shot at this product because of the higher level of HCA. I'm glad I did because my energy is up and have lost 5lbs in 2 weeks. Awesome product! Thanks!. After researching a few different brands of garcinia cambogia I took a shot at this product because of the higher level of HCA. I'm glad I did because my energy is up and have lost 5lbs in 2 weeks. Awesome product! Thanks!\", u'Ok. Ok', u'Works great for me.. Works great for me.', u\"I heard about this product and was a little skeptical, but I put all that aside and decided to try it. Started slow to make sure it didn't have any side effects on me and it has worked out fine. I started taking less than recommended dose and it still works. I've been helping with a little exercise but not enough to make that big a difference. I've lost 12 lbs. in three weeks something that would have been extremely difficult for me, without the Garcinia Cambogia, for me. Happy with the product and ordering more soon and I will up to the recommended dose, as I want to lose, at least, another 60 lbs..

Joint pain has plagued me as the years have gone on, and I have tried several of these before deciding on this one. It does the job well and doesn't have an aftertaste or 'come back on you' like some do. The results are well worth it as I can move much easier and with far less pain and fatigue.

My butt is starting to tone up as well as my flabby areas. I haven't been exercising at all. I feel more energetic than ever! I've been able to eat what I want. The only thing I changed about eating is what I drink. I drink more water now than soda. You can drink soda but try not to drink too much. I suggest taking the pills down with water to get the best results. Just follow the instructions on the bottle. Since taking this pill my periods have become regular. So if your not wanting regular periods then don't take it. As for the negative comments on here about these pills, I can tell you that these pills deffinatley work dispite what most say about them. I plan to buy another bottle next month and keep taking them till I get down to a size that I'm satisfied with. For those of you who are looking to lose alot of weight, your in luck!.

I finally got my husband to start taking these a few years ago (he did not believe in vitamin supplements) and he is a convert. We make sure not to run out anymore. I do not think I could live my life without them....between working full-time, raising two kids, working out...I need as much energy as I can get and these really help. I am glad to see other reviewers feel the same. Studies have come out that say vitamins don't do much but I don't think this particular vitamin was included...because anyone who has used regularly will tell you it DOES make a difference. Btw, if taking the pill first thing in the morning bothers your tummy, try taking at night after dinner..

Great, that's the first step. You want a magic pill that's just going to make it happen? Sorry, it just doesn't exist - not without willpower & common sense.Here's my experience - your mileage may vary:I started with the Raspberry Ketones Plus. I took three pills a day for about two weeks. I can honestly say I could feel my clothes (pants especially) getting a little looser.After about two weeks I added Garcinia Cambogia also at three times a day. Not much change.Still not melting the pounds away, I added Green Coffee extract a week later (last week). Here's where the changes started to begin.I don't just eat to live - I love to eat. I am a great cook, and not ashamed to admit it! In addition, I make sure to cook enough for dinner to have seconds, using the excuse that if there's enough leftover, I will save it for tomorrow's lunch - NOT!! The first few nights after starting the Coffee Bean extract, I had miserable sleeps. My gut was tossing & turning all night. I WAS STUFFED! I didn't bother changing my eating habits at all. That's when the light came on.Tonight's dinner was a normal cook EXCEPT we only cooked 1/2 as much! It's been two hours since we finished, & we both feel full. Yea, another 1/2 steak & some more fried spuds would have tasted good, but not necessary. This is where the common sense begins.Listen to your body, use your head! Are you really hungry? Or are you just mouth hungry? Think about it. Try some sensible eating habits - throw in a little exercise just for kicks! You won't lose an ounce just sitting there dreaming.I cannot say for sure that it's the Raspberry Ketones or the Garcinia Cambogia or the Green Coffee Extract - but the combination seems to be working for now.
