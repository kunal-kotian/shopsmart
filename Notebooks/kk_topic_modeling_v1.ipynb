      "Bioavailability is the key. I started taking this after both my parents died of cancer as it supposed to enhance your immune system - the story on 60 Minutes on resveratrol was incredibly inspiring. Doing some research on the Internet, it is indicated that taking resveratrol in lozenge form is preferable as it is broken down by stomach acids.  The ez-melt formula recommended in another review is OK, but it is dissolved in the mouth much more quickly than this lozenge formula, while dissolving more slowly is preferable according to my research.This product has the greatest side effect - since taking it, I haven't had colds or sore throats.  Soon after starting to take it every day, I was starting to come down with a cold, with all my usual symptoms, and was anticipating being very sick the next day, as is my usual pattern.  But I never did get as sick as anticipated - taking this product is the only reason I can come up with.  Since then, I've had no colds or sore throats - it has been great.  I recommend this product to everyone I know, and have given it as gifts to my family. \n",

      "I can't find this product any longer, and I wish I could.. I really liked this product because it stayed in my mouth for a long time and I felt it was probably doing some good.  I take a number of resveratrol products and this was one of my favorites.  I can't find it anymore and wish I could still find it.When I contacted the company, they said there was no date for re-introduction of this product, and they implied that it would no longer be produced.  I also found someplace online where the product manufacturer was trying to find someone to market it for them.  I hope this happens.  I really enjoyed taking these little pills and felt they were doing some good.  The claims on their website made sense, and I believe that resveratrol is almost a wonder drug/suppliment.  (The 60 Minutes Episode convinced me of that.) \n",
      "\n",
      "Just the Resveratrol product we need. Resveratrol is a polar compound, very insoluble in water and hence saliva.  To get sufficient Resveratrol absorbed a Resveratrol lozenge would have to stay in the mouth and be slowly dissolved.  The lozenge would have to contain enough Resveratrol since most of the Resveratrol will be swallowed with the saliva.  A better known and competing product contains only about a milligram of Resveratrol.  These lozenges contain 20 milligrams.  Nutrihill Resveratrol lozenges dissolve very slowly and contain, IMO, just the right amount of Resveratrol to optimize absorption.  Most of the product will be swallowed but that's OK as just fractions of a milligram need to be absorbed though the mouth's mucosa to produce sustained high levels of Resveratrol in the blood and be absorbed into the cells to do some real good.  I can see where many producers of Resveratrol products like, for example Revgenetics, would not want this product to catch on as their selling point is how well they try to increase absorption of Resveratrol in the digestive system.  Taking Quercetin helps protect Resveratrol when swallowed from first pass liver metabolism, but at an additional financial cost which makes suppliers happy because they can sell more supplements. An additional cost of taking Quercetin with Resveratrol is joint inflammation.I hope this product catches on so it's available from many sellers.Nutrihill Resveratrol Lozenges \n",
